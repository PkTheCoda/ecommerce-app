# About This Project

<p><b>Urban Escape</b> is a fictional ecommerce website I created. I decided to create this application to put my overall Web Development & React skills to the test. When first making the website, there were a few features that I wanted to add: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Allow users to travel across the website with routing</li>
  <li>Add a built-in cart system where users can add items to their cart</li>
  <li>Allow users to view their total "checkout" page</li>
  <li>Allow users to delete items from their cart in the checkout</li>
  <li>Make the design of the site responsive and visually pleasing</li>
</ol>

# Project Snapshots
When you first open up the application, you'll see this page:

Above is the homepage of the website. You can travel across the application with the nav-menu at the top or by pressing the "Visit the Store" button on the homepage. Pressing the button will take you to the "Store" page which will look something like this:

Above is the **Store** page of the application. This is where you can see all the fictional "items" sold at the store. You can see the price of the item along with the name. There are also multiple tags describing the product in the item-card as well. Each item-card has two main buttons: a **View More Details** button and **Add to Cart** button. When you click on the "**View More Details**" button, it will open a modal for the item you clicked on with more details like this:

There is a modal that'll open for each item! Click the **Add to Cart** button does exactly what you'd expect: it'll add whatever you clicked on to your cart. You can see the amount of items in your cart at the very top!

Once you have items in your cart, you can go ahead and click on the cart icon at the top which will show you what you ordered!

You can remove items from the list by clicking the little "**X**" icon. At the bottom is your total price. The checkout button doesn't really do anything since the button isn't connected with something like stripe (I don't see a point in doing that just yet)! Hope you liked the project

# Takeaways + Goals
Wow this project was really fun to make. I did a lot of styling and I (believe) that it looks decently good, especially for someone who has only been really learning web-dev for a solid 3-4 months. Here's what I learned making this project:

<ul>
  <li>State Management with React (Avoiding prop drilling!!)</li>
  <li>React's "useContext" hook. You don't want to know how much easier this made passing state down components</li>
  <li>React Routing! I had no idea that routing in React was so simple espcially when it looked complex from the beginning.</li>
  <li>Keyframes and Animations in CSS. Any animations you saw in this project were from me learning and applying them!</li>
</ul>

Adios
